## Neural Networks

### Notes:

So you might wonder what the inner workings of such a function where we shove in some animal pictures to get a cat, no-cat labeling might look like. [#]

This is where Neural Networks come into play. You might have heard about this phrase as it is the go to model today when it comes to machine learning.

At this point I will only give a very brief Introduction to the topic so you are familiar with the most important terminology.

If you stumbled over this topic before you might have seen some complicated graphic like this [#].

Which is fine for very small network because it shows you the input and output of each neuron such that you can more easily understnd that each neuron performs a specific matrix or tensor operation to transform its inputs.

But it will fail to deliver when it comes to more diverse structures.
Structures where an abstraction up to different layers is needed.
[#] Such that the in- and output layer is visible as well as the type of each hidden layer.
In this case you see fully connected layers meaning that each of the layer's neurons uses all outputs of the previous layer.

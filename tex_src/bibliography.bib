Literature

Source 1 is the paper originally presenting the GAN approach for machine learning and showing its application in image generation.
Source 2,3 and 4 are proposing text GAN models using a pretrained generative networks while Source 5 shows a technique without pretraining.
Source 6,7 and are showing more directed approaches to text generation.
